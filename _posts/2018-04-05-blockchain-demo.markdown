Explaining fairly involved and technical Blockchain concepts like Consensus, Fault Tolerance, Mining, Trustlessness, Transaction Signing, "chain of blocks", etc. and making them accessible can be challenging.

I've been looking for good visualizations and interactive demos, and I've found the two below so far.

I think with a little extra work these could work nicely to go through the whole process with a group / workshop, and make some of the more abstract, untangible concepts a bit more practically relevant.

Very cool, visually well-done and hands-on [Blockchain Demo](https://anders.com/blockchain/blockchain.html)

Slightly more cumbersome Bloomberg [How to Mine Bitcoin](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2014-interactive-bitcoin-miner/)
