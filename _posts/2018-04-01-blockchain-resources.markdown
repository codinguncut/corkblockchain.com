Below I have collected a couple of resources I've found helpful in going deeper on Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies.

I particularly found the courses "Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies" and "Introduction to Digital Currencies" helpful. The former put more emphasis on the technical background, while the latter focussed on monetary policy, banking and digital currencies.

### University of Nicosia

### Coursera (“audit” for free)
* [Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency/home/welcome)
	* Fantastic course that goes reasonably deep into UTXOs, consensus in the face of malicious nodes, etc. including programming exercises
