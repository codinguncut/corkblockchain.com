Very good presentations at the [iGov event](https://www.lero.ie/news-and-events/events/igov-delivering-public-services-using-blockchain) in Dublin with outstanding presentations by Roman Beck (University Copenhagen) on practical industry blockchain pilots & projects, and Pearse Ryan (Arthur Cox) on the legal status around "Smart Legal Contracts".

It was a joy to participate in the panel discussion, with many excellent questions and a solid discussion of the use cases for blockchain, its benefits and threats, social impact, etc.

Indeed very interesting to see how much is already done in the Public Sector around blockchain by governments like Estonia, Denmark, Dubai, etc.:
