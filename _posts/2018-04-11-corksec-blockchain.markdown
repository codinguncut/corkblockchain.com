Very Good session at [CorkSec #58](https://www.meetup.com/CorkSec/events/247900716/) last night.

The turnout was about 40 people at "An Spailpin Fanach" in Cork city center, and we had a good time having a few pints, and talking about the broader topic of blockchain, distributed ledgers and some of the challenges and opportunities around this, with a (small) emphasis on cryptography and security.

Thanks also to Kalli Schlauch, the second presenter, who talked about Reverse Engineering and creating a KeyGen, which caused me to reminisce about my +HCU, +ORK reverse engineering days 20 years ago [\[1\]](http://www.woodmann.com/fravia/orc1.htm), [\[2\]](http://www.textfiles.com/piracy/CRACKING/howtocrk.txt), ;)

Thank you to Robert McArdle as usual organizing a great event, and to the participants for fantastic engagement and some very challenging questions.
