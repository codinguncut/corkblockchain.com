---
We had an enjoyable first meetup of [Cork Blockchain](https://www.meetup.com/Cork-Blockchain/) meetup group today, somewhat shy of our 33 RSVPs ;)

Johannes presented on the basics of Blockchain as well as some details on Permissioned Blockchains like Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Sawtooth and Quorum, and we had an animated and fruitful discussion afterwards about consensus, proof-of-stake, storage solutions such as IPFS, smart contracts and many other relatively practical blockchain considerations.

Many thanks to all for coming and for actively participating, my apologies for the mis-communication about the venue change, and we are looking forward to an ever bigger crowd at next months meetup.
