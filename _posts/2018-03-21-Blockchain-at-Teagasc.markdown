Johannes gave a quick Blockchain Introduction at [Teagasc](https://www.teagasc.ie/), the Irish Agriculture and Food Development Authority.

We had hoped to stay away from Cryptocurrencies, crypto trading and energy xpenditure of the Bitcoin network, but there was such a large interest and many questions in the space, so that we ended up talking way more about Bitcoin than planned. But overall it was a very good exchange and event.
