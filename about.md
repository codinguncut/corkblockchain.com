This group is all about using Blockchain and Distributed Ledgers for real projects.

How do you determine whether blockchain is the right solution, how do you select the right implementation, should you choose Public or Consortium, how to deal with consensus, storage, GDPR, etc.

You can find us on meetup at [Cork Blockchain](cork-blockchain).
